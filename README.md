In this repository (WORK IN PROGRESS) I intend to experiment on the "Latent Program Network"(LPN) architecture from ["Searching Latent Program Spaces"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08706) by Bonnet & Macfarlane (2024).

Some of the code is taken from their GitHub repository: [https://github.com/clement-bonnet/lpn](https://github.com/clement-bonnet/lpn)

The idea is to leverage [ARC_gym framework](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/ARC_gym) to experiement with the out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of the LPN. I will train it and test it on structurally distinct tasks to see to what extent it is able to generalize to new problems.
